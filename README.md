# Screenshooter

## This tool was created to take full screenshots of the user's desktop(s) when beacon doesn't want to work.

To use, run the file and it will create a screenshot and save it in the current directory with a timestamped name. You can also pass it a flag for the location/filename where you want it saved. For some examples:

`Screenshooter.exe`

`Screenshooter.exe C:\Users\Public\Documents\`

`Screenshooter.exe C:\Users\Public\Documents\screenshot.png`
